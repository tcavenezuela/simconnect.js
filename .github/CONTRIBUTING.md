# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to simconnect.js!

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open, simulator logs, etc)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...
- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/tcavenezuela/simconnect.js/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

## Set up your development environment

simconnect.js is a monorepo. That means the whole solution is broken into small pieces, or packages, each of which solves a specific problem. No need to worry much about it, since [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) does most of the work for us. If you are not familiarized with it it's always helpful to have an overall idea of how it works.

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

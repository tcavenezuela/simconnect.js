The available nodes that can be checked using this SimVar must be previously defined in the [CAMERA_RAY_NODE_COLLISION] of the camera.cfg file. The SimVar requires a node index value between 1 and 10, corresponding to the node defined in the CFG file, and the SimVar will return 1 (TRUE) if there is a collision along the camera ray or 0 (FALSE) otherwise. You may also supply an index of 0 to perform a collision check for all defined nodes, in which case the SimVar will return 1 (TRUE) if there is a collision between the ray and any of the defined nodes.
